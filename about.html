                    I was born and raised in <span property="birthPlace" typeof="Place"><span property="address" typeof="PostalAddress">North <span property="addressRegion" content="QLD">Queensland</span>, <span property="addressCountry">Australia</span></span></span> and began experimenting at an early age. I pursued an education in Information Technology at <span property="alumniOf" typeof="EducationalOrganization"><a property="url" href="http://www.jcu.edu.au/"><span property="name">James Cook University</span></a></span>. I started my career building and maintaining websites for local businesses. I joined <span property="affiliation" typeof="Organisation"><a property="url" href="http://www.mojitosolutions.com/"><span property="name">Mojito Solutions</span></a></span> for several years developing custom web-applications for clients including ticket-booking systems and subscription service systems.

            <p>
                    In 2012 I joined a, then, small team at <a href="http://www.safetyculture.com.au/">SafetyCulture</a>, where I co-developed the first generation of their workplace safety management platform. I continue to work in a senior development role with SafetyCulture developing future generations of their software. I'm a regular presenter at North Queensland industry events and a strong supporter of the Townsville development community.
